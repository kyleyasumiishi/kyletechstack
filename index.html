                    <p>Welcome! This website showcases one of my favorite places to work, play, and hangout: my personal home office gaming/workstation. Below, you can read more about me and why I built my very own mancave.</p>
                    <h2>Who?</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Kyle. I've been interested in technology since I was a kid. One of my earliest memories of computers piquing my interest was during a family camping trip. On the way to a beautiful state park camping ground along the Washington coast, my family must have stopped at a store or gas station, because I remember somewhere on the journey I convinced my parents to buy me my first ever copy of the magazine PC World. That issue ranked the 101 best free web apps at the time, covering a range of categories from email accounts and productivity suites, to music players and photo editors. I can't remember if I even even owned my own computer at the time, but I read that magazine cover to cover multiple times over that summer.</p>
                    <p>At some point, I bought my first laptop. I think it was a Compaq, and it definitely did not have a wireless adapter built in. For a while, I used it without internet access at all - I was ecstatic just having my very own PC to play with. Eventually I got my hands on a wireless USB stick, at which point I downloaded and taught myself the vast majority of those 101 top web apps. There was no practical reason for me to have opened email accounts with Yahoo, Gmail, and MSN, but I did because all of those were featured in that magazine.</p>
                    <p>My love of technology stayed with me throughout my childhood and into adulthood. In middle school and high school, I took a major interest in video games, and basically grew up in the dawn of social media, iTunes, and then smartphones and video and music streaming. I took a web development course in high school, but didn't stick with coding after that class until I rediscovered how fun it was after college. In college, I became fascinated with low-cost tech and bought at least 3 Chromebooks and other netbooks, which opened my eyes to the world of Linux (via Crouton).</p>
                    <p>After my first job in college, I spent several months teaching myself to code full time. I had a blast during these months of self study, and wrote thousands of lines of code and became really interested in computer science. While returning to college to study CS wasn't in the cards for me at the time, I knew I wanted to work in the tech industry - and I've been enjoying the ride at my current job ever since! </p>
                    <h2>What?</h2>
                    <p>Despite my love of technology going back as long as I remember, I've never owned a higher-end computer. Growing up, my family owned fairly average computers and we had a modest internet connections, which always seemed incredibly fast after years of dial-up internet. In college, I  took pride in knowing that I could complete all my assignments with a $200 Chromebook running Linux.</p>
                    <p>Then, a couple years ago I decided I wanted to build my own PC. I waited for a long time before actually pursuing this, as I felt like I didn't have a practical reason to build a PC. I imagined my interest in video games would rekindle if I built a higher-end gaming rig, but it wasn't until late 2019 when I pulled the trigger and bought a PC case from my friend who was upgrading his system. My thinking at the time was that if I bought a tower, eventually I would buy the other components - and that's exactly what happened. Over the first couple months of 2020 I researched parts, watched hours of YouTube videos, and eventually bought and built my very first gaming PC.</p>
                    <h2>When?</h2>
                    <p>I bought all the parts and build my PC in the past 6 months.</p>
                    <h2>Why?</h2>
                    <p>I decided to build my PC for a few reasons. First, I wanted to learn how to build a computer. This was an admittedly expensive education, but it was incredibly rewarding and educational. Second, I wanted to play modern video games at high settings. Accomplished. Finally, I wanted a workstation that would allow me to work from home and have a dedicated system for programming and doing personal projects.</p>
