                <div class="home-content">
                    <p>Welcome! This website showcases all of the components that make up one of my favorite places to work, play, and hangout - my personal home office gaming/workstation.</p>
                    <p>I've loved computers ever since I was a kid. I have a very distinct memory of 14-year-old Kyle randomly picking up a copy of PC World on the way to a family camping trip. It was one of the issues that covered 101 best free software (<a href="https://archive.org/details/pcworld255unse/mode/2up" target="_blank">this one</a>), and I read that issue cover to cover multiple times that summer. In college I became really interested in tinkering with "low-end" computers to sqeeze maximum performance out of relatively inexpensive hardware like Chromebooks and Raspberry Pi, picking up basic skills in Linux and programming along the way.</p>
                    <p>However despite my passion for tech, I never owned a "high-end" computer until 2020 when I decided to build my own PC. I had a few goals in mind when I finally set out to build it:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span class="bold">Learn how to build a computer.</span> This required dozens of hours of researching parts and learning about how computers work. I enjoy learning new things, and this was definitely a fun - albeit expensive - educational experience.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Build a gaming PC.</span> I wanted to experience my favorite games (Skyrim, Witcher 3, Halo MCC) and new ones with solid hardware on max settings.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Build a powerful productivity workstation.</span> I started building my PC right before COVID-19 took off in the U.S. With remote work looking to become the new norm, I figured 2020 was a good time to splurge on a home workstation setup, including a standing desk, multiple monitors, and an ergonomic chair. I also wanted a powerful PC that would let me pursue my hobby of programming and build cool projects like this website.</li>
