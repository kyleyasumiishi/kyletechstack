# Kyle Yasumiishi's Tech Stack

This <a href="https://kyleyasumiishi.github.io/kyletechstack/">website</a> showcases my PC and home workstation setup.

## About

I built this website mainly for two reasons:

1. <b>Document my tech stack for easy reference.</b> I built my first PC and home workstation setup in early 2020, and I wanted a quick and easy way to look up what components I used to remind myself or show others.</li>
2. <b>Practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</b> I'm diving back into web development and programming, and I wanted to build a static website that would allow me to brush up on my fundamentals and shed light on what concepts I need more practice on in future projects.

## Lessons Learned

Here are a few concepts I learned, re-learned, and practiced by creating this static website:

* Several key git commands such as `git clone`, `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`, `git push`, and `git pull`</li>
* CSS flexbox to dynamically resize pages on different screen sizes
* JavaScript's `addEventListener()` method to execute a expand/collapse function when users click a button representing a PC or workstation componenet 
* JavaScript's `getElementById()` to select an HTML element and `getElementsByClassName()` to work with an HTMLCollection of elements
* Markdown to write this README.md. I used my <a href="https://kyleyasumiishi.github.io/markdown/#">Markdown Previewer</a> to test out the styling before deploying
* GitHub Pages to host the static website
